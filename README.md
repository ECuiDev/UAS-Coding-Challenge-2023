## Repository Information
Program code can be found in [main.py](https://github.com/ECuiDev/UAS-Coding-Challenge-2023/blob/main/main.py).

## Program Information
This program lets the user input coordinates of a line segment and data for either a circle or cylinder, verifies these inputs, and then returns the points of intersection (if any). It calculates intersections with a circle by using the slope-intercept form of a line and the quadratic equation. Intersections with a cylinder are done by first projecting a 3D line into 2D, performing a number of calculations, and then projecting the line back into 3D using the parametric form of a line.
